										<p>I'm Matthew Turzai, a junior at the University of Notre Dame balancing my roles as a boxing captain and a committed member of the Naval ROTC. Leadership and strategy are my arena, both in the ring and in service. With a keen interest in front-end web development, I craft dynamic websites that stand at the intersection of functionality and innovation. My journey is about fighting with purpose, serving with honor, and coding with passion.
