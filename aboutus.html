										<p>Hi! I'm a junior at the University of Notre Dame, where studying Computer Science with a special passion for software engineering and the business side of tech. Balancing code with fitness, I believe in keeping both mind and body sharp. Beyond the screen, I'm driven by the power of community, always looking for ways to bring people together and foster collaboration. Having built software to optimize business operations and analtyics in the Vending and Micro-market industry, I now turn my attention to creating a useful and entertaining fitness application with Atlas.

										<h3>Eamon Tracey</h3>
										<p>Hello! My name is Eamon Tracey, and I am a junior computer engineering major at the University of Notre Dame. I enjoy programming and have developed significant experience, whether it be steering rockets on the Notre Dame Rocketry Team, publishing iOS jailbreak tweaks with tens of thousands of users, contributing to the Ansible Automation Hub at Red Hat, reverse-engineering and disrupting a particular social media algorithm, and more. Now, I set my sights on fostering a strong, connected fitness community through Atlas.</p>

										<p>Howdy! I am a current junior at the University of Notre Dame coming from Fort Worth, Texas.  I have experience working with multiple ai libraries in python and am proficient in C and Python development. I am also an avid exerciser, regularly lifting and running. I hope to use my expertise in these areas to combine all the best parts of various workout trackers to create a living app that thrives on community engagement and development.

										<h3>Yanni Vu</h3>
										<p>Hi I'm Yanni, a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame. My passion lies in web development, but my background is extensive. I have experience with C and Python programming, so transitioning to Dart in order to build ATLAS should not be a problem. I enjoy pushing myself in all aspects of life whether it be physical or academically. I regularly follow a bodybuilding program and run, so I am excited to be able to share my passion of exercise with others on ATLAS.
